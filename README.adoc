Mailed-In-Time is a simple web application for delayed sending of e-mail messages.

You will never forget to congratulate your friend with his Birthday! Just set a text and a subject, add an attachment
and of course his e-mail address, and choose a day when he should receive the congratulation message.

This project is a base for few educational projects of mine.

The project should be published on Maven local repository as a library by executing the corresponding Gradle task.

To make a working app it`s necessary to create a new project, add dependency to this project (as a library) and add some
necessary classes:

* main class (for example one with @SpringBootApplication),
* implementation of PlannedMessageStorageService interface,
* and so on.

So anyone can use it this way for educational purposes adding Spring Security layer or Spring Data MongoDB, etc.
